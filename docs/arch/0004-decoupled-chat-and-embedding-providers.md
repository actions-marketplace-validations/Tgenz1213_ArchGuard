# Decoupled chat and embedding providers

## Context

Every `llm.Provider` implementation (OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini) has always implemented `Chat`, `CreateEmbedding`, and `CountTokens` together, and `internal/cli.Execute` constructed exactly one provider instance from `llm.provider`, used for all three. Adding Claude support breaks this assumption: Anthropic's API has no embeddings endpoint at all, so a `ClaudeProvider` can implement `Chat`/`CountTokens` but must fail `CreateEmbedding`.

`config.VectorStore.Provider` (`vector_store.provider` in YAML) already existed in the config schema and appeared in every example config, but nothing in the codebase ever read it -- vector store *backend* selection (`LocalStore` vs `PgStore`) goes by `vector_store.connection_string`, and the embedding *model* backend was implicitly whatever `llm.provider` was.

## Decision

`vector_store.provider` becomes the explicit selector for which provider handles `CreateEmbedding`, decoupled from `llm.provider` (which continues to select the provider for `Chat`/`CountTokens`). When unset, it defaults to `llm.provider` -- every existing config, where `vector_store.provider` is set to the same value as `llm.provider` or left unset, behaves identically to before.

`internal/analysis.Engine` has an `EmbedProvider` (an `llm.Embedder`, falling back to `Provider` when nil), so every provider implementation and every single-provider config is untouched and `internal/cli` needs one resolution step, not a rewrite. `llm.Provider` is `Embedder` plus `Chatter`; a provider lacking a half implements an error stub for it.

`internal/cli.validateProviderConfig` enforces three provider-pairing invariants that can't be expressed in the YAML schema itself:

- `llm.provider: "claude"` requires `vector_store.provider` to be set explicitly. There's no safe default to fall back to, since falling back to `llm.provider` itself would mean falling back to Claude, which can't embed.
- `vector_store.provider: "claude"` is rejected unconditionally. Claude can't embed regardless of which provider is handling chat, so it can never validly fill the embedding role either.
- `llm.provider: "voyage"` is rejected unconditionally, regardless of `vector_store.provider`. Voyage has no chat API at all -- unlike Claude, which at least has a valid *conditional* path as `llm.provider` once `vector_store.provider` is set, no config makes Voyage work as the chat provider.

All three fail fast at config load (`ExitConfig`, exit code 3) rather than surfacing as a runtime error from the provider's `Chat` or `CreateEmbedding` method.

`ARCHGUARD_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` is a new, optional environment variable, read only when the resolved embedding provider (`vector_store.provider`, or `llm.provider` when `vector_store.provider` is unset) differs from the chat provider. It does not fall back to `ARCHGUARD_API_KEY` when unset: whenever this branch runs, the embedding provider is necessarily a different vendor than the chat provider, so falling back would mean sending one vendor's API key to a different vendor's API. A credential should never cross a vendor boundary, so `buildProvider` is called with an empty string (triggering the same "no API key set" warning any other misconfigured provider gets) rather than reusing `ARCHGUARD_API_KEY`. `ARCHGUARD_API_KEY` continues to supply the chat provider's key unchanged.

Two new providers land alongside this: `ClaudeProvider` (`Chat`/`CountTokens` via the official Anthropic Go SDK; `CreateEmbedding` always errors) and `VoyageProvider` (`CreateEmbedding` only, via Voyage AI's HTTP API -- no official Go SDK exists, so this is hand-rolled `net/http`, unlike the other three providers). Voyage is Anthropic's own documented recommendation for pairing with Claude, but `vector_store.provider` isn't restricted to Voyage -- `openai`, `ollama`, or `gemini` work equally well as the embedding provider for a `claude` chat provider.

`VoyageProvider.CreateEmbedding` supports both Voyage's `embed()` endpoint (`POST /v1/embeddings`, one vector per call) and `contextualized_embed()` endpoint (`POST /v1/contextualizedembeddings`, chunk-aware embeddings for `voyage-context-*` models), selected automatically by the configured model name. `contextualized_embed()` is always called with exactly one chunk per call (`inputs: [[text]]`), matching `CreateEmbedding`'s one-text-in/one-vector-out contract -- this gets access to Voyage's higher-quality contextualized models without requiring the rest of the codebase (`VectorStore.Search`, `ADR.Embedding`, `LocalStore`'s JSON schema, `PgStore`'s `archguard_adrs` table) to support multiple vectors per document. True multi-chunk-per-document indexing, where a long ADR is split into several chunks each embedded with awareness of the others, is a genuinely different and larger feature -- useful to any provider, not specific to Voyage or Claude -- and is deliberately not implemented here.

## Consequences

- A user pairing `llm.provider: claude` with any embedding-capable `vector_store.provider` gets a config-time error, not a runtime one, if they forget to set it, or if they set `vector_store.provider` to `claude` itself. `llm.provider: voyage` is rejected at config load unconditionally, regardless of `vector_store.provider`.
- A cross-vendor pairing (e.g. `llm.provider: claude` with `vector_store.provider: voyage`) requires two separate API keys, `ARCHGUARD_API_KEY` and `ARCHGUARD_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` -- there is no shared-key convenience path, by design, since the two providers are different vendors.
- `internal/analysis.Engine` and `internal/index`'s `BuildIndex` never needed a signature change -- `BuildIndex` already only ever calls `CreateEmbedding`, so `internal/cli` just needed to pass the resolved embedding provider into it instead of the chat provider.
- Every future provider that can't do both chat and embeddings (or vice versa) fits this same pattern: implement `llm.Provider`, return an error from the unsupported method(s), and let `vector_store.provider` (or, symmetrically, `llm.provider`, as Claude and Voyage already demonstrate for each direction) resolve the pairing. `validateProviderConfig` is the place to add a fail-fast check if the new provider can never validly fill one of the two roles.
- `cmd/archguard-e2e/main.go` supplies two distinct mock providers, one per role (`internal/cli.Execute`'s `ProviderFactories{Chat, Embed}` struct), reusing the chat mock for embedding only when the two provider names match, else failing fast if no embed factory was given -- `test/e2e_dual_provider_test.go` exercises the dual-provider split through a real `archguard index` + `archguard check` subprocess run, not just at the unit level.
